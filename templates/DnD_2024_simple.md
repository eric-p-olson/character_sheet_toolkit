### Simplified fillable character sheet pdf for 2024 5th Edition D&D

Inspired by WotC pre-generated characters' sheets 

DnD_2024_simple-properties supports:
- proficiency splitting: armor checkbox
- equipment list
- features, traits, feats: top 3 tracking boxs
- attacks: defined weapons (cantrips soon)

Notes
- There is no data for features/traits/feats beyond what is in the xml, since those are specific to WotC rules
- you must modify your xml data for attack-effects and other modification features/traits/feats
